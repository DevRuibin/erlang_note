# Erlang Study Notes

This is a collection of notes I took while learning Erlang.
I am a very beginner in Erlang, so the content is very basic.

While it may become more comprehensive in the future,
it is not intended to be a complete Erlang tutorial.
I just want to make it as a quick reference for myself.

Until for now, the notes are mainly based on:

1. [Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/erlang/)
2. [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Bc411W7fD/?p=24&spm_id_from=333.1007.top_right_bar_window_history.content.click)
